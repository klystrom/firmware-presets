#$ TITLE: Klystrom Clean Build F4

#$ CATEGORY: FILTERS

#$ KEYWORDS: klystrom, KlystromFPV, filter, filters, clean
#$ AUTHOR: KlystromFPV
#$ DESCRIPTION: For clean builds, very little filtering. Using F4 with Bidirectional DSHOT. For F4, FC should be running 4K PID loop which requires a static LPF of 500Hz to remove aliasing issues.
